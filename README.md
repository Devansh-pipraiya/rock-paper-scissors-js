## 📚 What I Learned

- **JavaScript Basics**: Function scope, structure, conditionals (`if/else`, `switch`), loops, and random generation.
  
- **User Input Handling**: Evolved from prompts to **interactive buttons** using **event listeners**.
  
- **DOM Manipulation**: Querying elements, updating content, and class toggles for animations.
  
- **UI Integration**: Combining logic with HTML/CSS for clean visual feedback while preserving console elements.
  
- **Clean Code Practices**: used clear names, short functions, and comments to make everything easy to follow

## ⌛ Project Evolution

This project was originally a pure console-based Rock Paper Scissors game (using prompts and console output).  
Now its a full interactive browser game


> The original console logs remain active for anyone curious — just open DevTools while playing.  
> To check v1.0 click on `main branch and then **v1.0** under the tag tab` — that's the classic console-only version.
